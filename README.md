This repository contains all course assignments for my **Data Science with Python, ML.NET and NimbusML** course and will get you up to speed with Microsoft's new ML.NET library and the NimbusML package for Python.

By working through the code examples, you will learn how to design, train, and evaluate complex AI models in Python. The NimbusML package will allow you to call the powerful ML.NET machine learning library directly from your Python code. I'll provide you with all the code, libraries, and data sets you need to get started.

Please note that this repository only contains code examples with no additional support.
